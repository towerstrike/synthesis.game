# Synthesis Game

> **Take back humanity and find the cure. Fight zombies and build factories. Play with friends or foes.**

A hardcore survival automation game where manual work means death. Build massive factory networks across a planet-scale voxel world to survive the zombie apocalypse and find humanity's salvation.

## üßü Survive the Wasteland

The world has fallen. Cities lie in ruins, overrun by the infected. You're one of the last survivors, racing against time to find a cure before humanity is lost forever.

### Choose Your Apocalypse
- **Dynamic world decay** - experience the world days, months, or years after the fall
- **Procedural ruins** with realistic building destruction and environmental storytelling
- **Planet-scale exploration** - traverse entire continents searching for resources and answers
- **Day/night cycles** where venturing out becomes increasingly dangerous

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automate or Die

In this hostile world, **automation isn't a convenience‚Äîit's survival**. Manual labor attracts zombies and wastes precious time you don't have.

### Build Your Industrial Empire
- **Factory networks** spanning vast distances to process resources automatically
- **Automated defenses** that protect your bases while you're away exploring
- **Research automation** to develop better equipment and progress toward the cure
- **Supply chains** connecting scattered outposts across the dangerous landscape

### Scavenge and Expand
- Strip abandoned factories and cities for materials
- Establish outposts in strategic locations
- Connect remote mining operations with transport networks
- Scale from basic survival to massive industrial complexes

## üåê Trust No One (Or Everyone)

### Massive Multiplayer Survival
- **Planet-wide servers** with hundreds of players competing for limited resources
- **Resource scarcity** creates natural tension - cooperate or compete?
- **Raid or trade** - attack other players' bases or form strategic alliances
- **Information warfare** - share cure research or keep discoveries secret

### Your Choice of Allies
- **Friends**: Share resources, defend each other's bases, collaborate on cure research
- **Foes**: Raid supply lines, sabotage competitors, steal hard-earned research data
- **Neutral**: Play the politics, form temporary alliances when convenient

## üéÆ Hardcore by Design

### Roguelike Survival
- **Permadeath** - when you die, your character and all progress is lost
- **Resource permanence** - destroyed materials don't respawn
- **Real consequences** for every decision and risk taken
- **Optional casual mode** for players who want the experience without the stress

### The Cure Awaits
- **Research progression** unlocks new automation technologies and survival tools
- **Collaborative discovery** - some breakthroughs require multiple players working together
- **Multiple paths** to finding the cure, each with different risks and rewards
- **End game content** for players who successfully restore civilization

## üöÄ Get Started

```bash
# Build and run
./build.sh
