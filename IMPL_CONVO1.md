# Implementation Conversation Context - Session 1

## Initial Query Context
- User requested detailed implementation order for core module files
- Target: deterministic game engine with 1 TPS simulation, high-freq rendering
- Architecture: Radically decoupled voxel RTS engine with lockstep networking

## Codebase State Analysis
- Project: synthesis.game - freestanding C++20 game engine with modules
- Build system: Meson with custom discovery script
- Module structure: `module/core/` contains interface units with descriptive comments
- Existing files analyzed: type, platform, trait, semantic, error, result, optional, math, time, random, atomic, thread, pair, span, hash, compare
- Each module file contains single-line comment describing intended functionality

## User Requirements Clarification
- User corrected assumption about empty files - all contain descriptive comments
- Requested addition of floating-point math module for rendering (non-deterministic)
- Selected "fp" as module name over alternatives (float, real, calc)
- Emphasized need for "tiny bit more detail" in implementation plan
- Extended discussion on fp performance optimization with platform-specific intrinsics
- Decided on ISA-specific implementation files: `src/fp.neon` (ARM), `src/fp.x86` (Intel/AMD)
- Added tensor module concept for recursive N-dimensional containers

## Architecture Dissertation Integration
- User provided comprehensive architectural dissertation covering:
  - 1 TPS deterministic simulation core with fixed-point arithmetic
  - Simulation/render thread separation with triple buffer
  - Deterministic lockstep networking with reliable UDP
  - Client-side prediction and server reconciliation
  - Graphics Abstraction Platform (GAP) for Vulkan/Metal/DirectX12
  - Temporal smoothing engine for 60fps+ rendering from 1 TPS sim
  - Voxel world system with chunk-based storage
  - Headless testing framework with cross-platform CI

## Final Output Requirements
- User explicitly rejected code implementation
- Demanded markdown plan with three hierarchy levels:
  - High level: Strategic phases
  - Medium level: Domain-specific technical tasks  
  - Low level: Implementation specifics
- Equal weight distribution across hierarchy levels
- Concise, succinct task descriptions

## Key Technical Constraints
- Freestanding C++20 environment (no stdlib)
- Fixed-point arithmetic for determinism
- Compiler flags: `/fp:strict`, `-fno-fast-math`, `-ffp-contract=off`
- POD-only ECS components
- Cross-platform: Windows/x64, Linux/x64, macOS/aarch64
- Lock-free triple buffer for thread communication
- xxHash64 for state verification

## Deliverables Created
1. Core module implementation order (50+ modules prioritized)
2. Added `fp` module for floating-point rendering math
3. Comprehensive implementation plan (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) with 8 phases
4. This context recovery document
5. Refined fp/tensor architecture with SIMD optimization strategy

## Todo List State Progression
- Started: Analyze codebase structure
- Completed: Created detailed implementation roadmap
- Final state: 50+ tasks spanning foundation â†’ optimization phases

## Critical Architecture Decisions
- 1 TPS simulation rate for massive scale RTS gameplay
- Triple buffer over mutex/queue for simulation-render communication  
- Fixed-point arithmetic over floating-point for determinism
- Client-server lockstep over peer-to-peer for robustness
- Offline shader compilation over runtime compilation
- Headless testing as first-class architectural component
- ISA-specific floating-point optimization: NEON for ARM64, AVX2/FMA for x86
- Recursive tensor template design for unified scalar/vector/matrix operations
- Separation of fp (scalar functions) and tensor (N-dimensional containers) modules

## Implementation Priority Matrix
Phase 1: Deterministic foundation (types, math, timing, PRNG)
Phase 2: Concurrency (threading, atomic, triple buffer)
Phase 3: Graphics abstraction (GAP, backends, shaders)
Phase 4: Temporal smoothing (prediction, reconciliation, extrapolation)
Phase 5: Collections (deterministic containers, memory management)
Phase 6: Networking (reliable UDP, lockstep, session management)
Phase 7: Voxel systems (storage, rendering, physics)
Phase 8: RTS gameplay (AI, pathfinding, economy, combat)
